# FizzBuzz
### This was the FizzBuzz precourse task on week 4 of the pre-course. 
### It introduced us further to TDD(Test Driven Development) and was our first time pairing with someone else in the cohort and in general. 
### I paired with Bryn and over two pairing sessions learnt alot about pairing and TDD.
